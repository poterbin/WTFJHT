1/ **The government shutdown is causing more economic damage than previously estimated and could push the U.S. economy into a [contraction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraction.asp)**. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett called "the damage" to the economy "a little bit worse" than anticipated, because they miscalculated the rate of damage by failing to account for government contractors. Meanwhile, the White House revised estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers, which shows that the shutdown – now in its 26th day – reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasts. By comparison, last year's economic growth for the first quarter totaled 2.2% ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/government-shutdown-economy.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/politics/kevin-hassett-shutdown-economic-growth/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/685845545/shutdown-will-be-worse-for-economy-than-first-thought-white-house-says))

2/ **The Trump administration continues to add more federal workers to the list of employees who are required to work without pay.** By designating their jobs as essential or exempting them from the furlough, the Trump administration has sent thousands of employees back to work without compensation. The IRS, for example, will officially be recalling 36,000 workers – more than half the IRS workforce – to process tax returns and refunds despite the shutdown. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/politics/trump-workers-essential-furlough/index.html))

* **The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said that flying is "less safe today than it was a month ago" due to the partial government shutdown**. The FAA is trying to recall thousands of workers who had been furloughed that they deem essential to deal with safety concerns. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/425597-national-air-traffic-controllers-association-flying-is-less-safe))

* **Federal workers lose more than $200 million in combined unpaid wages for every workday the the government remains shutdown.** A typical federal worker has missed $5,000 in wages since the shutdown began. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/16/us/politics/federal-shutdown-salaries.html))

3/ **Nancy Pelosi asked Trump reschedule his State of the Union address – or just submit it in writing – while the government remains shut down**. Pelosi cited "security concerns" related to the shutdown's effect on the Secret Service. White House officials, meanwhile, are urging Republican senators to not sign a bipartisan letter calling for an end of the government shutdown. Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Jan. 29th, which is an opportunity for him to make his case for border wall funding in a prime-time televised address.

4/ **ISIS claimed responsibility for an explosion that killed at least two U.S. troops in northern Syria**. The attack comes weeks after Trump claimed the U.S. had "defeated ISIS in Syria" and announced he would pull out all 2,000 American forces. The announcement triggered the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

5/ **Nine T-Mobile executives booked rooms at Trump's hotel in D.C. a day after the company announced a merger that required Trump's approval.** Staffers at the Trump International Hotel were handed a list of incoming "VIP Arrivals" last April following the announcement of a $26 billion deal with Sprint, which would more than double T-Mobile's value and significantly increase its share of the cellphone market. T-Mobile executives have repeatedly returned to Trump's hotel since, with one T-Mobile executive racking up 10 visits to the hotel between April and July.

## Notables.

1. **Trump's pick to replace Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA will face questions from lawmakers during his confirmation hearing.** Andrew Wheeler has been serving as the acting EPA administrator since Pruitt stepped down in July amid numerous ethics investigations. Democrats are expected to ask Wheeler about his connections to coal companies that he represented as a lobbyist, of which [Wheeler says](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-chief-andrew-wheeler-ashamed-work-coal-company/story?id=56497860) he is "not at all ashamed." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chaos-government-shutdown-trumps-nominee-replace-pruitt-epa/story?id=60400921))

2. **A Belarusian woman who claimed to have 16 hours of audio recordings linking Russia to Trump's election will be deported after spending nearly a year behind bars in Thailand.** Anastasia Vashukevich pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation and conspiracy in the Pattaya Provincial Court. Vashukevich requested asylum in the U.S. in exchange for her recordings, which she claimed contained evidence that could help shed light on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The audio evidence that Vashukevich claimed to have has never materialized. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/world/asia/belarusian-escort-deported-thailand.html))

3. **Trump called a New York Times reporter and defended Russia against claims of election interference the day after he met privately with Putin.** Trump insisted that the call remain off the record while arguing that the Russians had been falsely accused of interfering in the 2016 election. Trump and Putin have met five times in private and the U.S. has no records or notes from any of their conversations. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html) / [The Week](https://theweek.com/speedreads/817988/trump-reportedly-called-journalist-defend-russia-right-after-private-meeting-putin-2017))

4. **Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to enforce sanctions against Russian companies controlled by a Putin ally**, despite a group of 11 GOP senators [joining](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/republicans-sanctions-russian-oligarchs.html) Democrats in the vote. The vote fell three votes shy of the 60-vote threshold, ensuring that the sanctions on the companies tied to Oleg Deripaska, including the world's second-largest aluminum company, Rusal, will be lifted as part of a deal negotiated by the Treasury Department.

5. **Paul Manafort worked with unknown intermediaries to place people in the Trump administration in January 2017**.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/15/mueller-manafort-stock-trump-administration-1102373))

6. **Konstantin Kilimnik "appears to be at the heart of pieces of Mueller's investigation" into Russian interference in the 2016 election**.

7. **The U.S. rejected a Russian offer to save the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty**, saying "we see no indication that Russia would choose compliance."
